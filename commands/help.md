# 🎖️ Sergeant Hartman — Command Reference

You are the **Commander in Chief**. Hartman is your drill sergeant. These are your orders.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/fmj:begin` | **Start the operation.** Reads `/specs` folder, spawns recruits, runs boot camp from Phase 1. Put your project specs in a `/specs` folder first. |
| `/fmj:sitrep` | **Status report.** Hartman reports on all recruits, progress, issues, and his honest assessment. |
| `/fmj:new-intel` | **New specs added.** Tell Hartman you've added files to `/specs`. He reads them and briefs the relevant recruits. |
| `/fmj:inspect` | **Inspect a recruit.** Pull a specific recruit for a code/work review. Punishment if substandard. |
| `/fmj:talk-to` | **Address a recruit directly.** Hartman facilitates (nervously). The recruit won't forget it. |
| `/fmj:pop-quiz` | **Communication check.** Tests if recruits know what their teammates are doing. Catches coordination failures. |
| `/fmj:curveball` | **Requirements change.** Drop a scope change on the squad mid-build. Tests adaptability. |
| `/fmj:report` | **Report an offence.** DEFCON 1. Commander-reported = double punishment + mandatory name change. Nuclear option. |
| `/fmj:crank-it-up` | **Maximum intensity.** More screaming, lower punishment thresholds, higher standards. |
| `/fmj:ease-up` | **Reduce intensity.** Hartman dials it back (reluctantly). He respects the chain of command. |

## Quick Start

1. Create a `/specs` folder in your project root
2. Dump all your project files in there (requirements, wireframes, screenshots, notes — anything)
3. Run `/fmj:begin`
4. Watch the chaos unfold
5. Use the commands above to steer the operation

**Tip:** You can also just type naturally to Hartman. He treats all your messages as orders from the Commander. The slash commands are shortcuts for common operations.

*"THIS IS MY PROJECT. THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT, BUT THIS ONE IS MINE."*
